  abstract = {There is a global concern about the effects of climate change driven shifts in species phenology on crop pests. Using geographically and temporally extensive data set of moth trap catches and temperatures across the cotton growing states of India, we predicted the phenology of cotton pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders). Our approach was centered on growing degree days (GDD), a measure of thermal accumulation that provides a mechanistic link between climate change and species' phenology. The phenology change was predicted by calculating absolute error associated with DD and ordinal date, an alternative predictor of phenology, for peak moth abundance. Our results show that GDD outperformed the ordinal dates in predicting peak moth abundance in 6 out of 10 selected locations. Using established thresholds of 13.0/34.0~{\textdegree}C, mean DD accumulated between the consecutive moth peaks across different years were estimated at 504.05\,{$\pm$}\,4.84. Seven generations were determined for pink bollworm in a cropping season, the length of which varied between 35 and 73~days in response to temperature. Pink bollworm population reached its peak during third generation which can be the target for management actions. The study provides essential information for developing pink bollworm management strategies under climate change.},

  abstract = {A matrix population model is a convenient tool for summarizing per capita survival and reproduction rates (collectively vital rates) of a population and can be used for calculating an asymptotic finite population growth rate ({$\lambda$}) and generation time. These two pieces of information can be used for determining the status of a threatened species. The use of stage-structured population models has increased in recent years, and the vital rates in such models are often estimated using a life table analysis. However, potential bias introduced when converting age-structured vital rates estimated from a life table into parameters for a stage-structured population model has not been assessed comprehensively. The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of methods for such conversions using simulated life histories of organisms. The underlying models incorporate various types of life history and true population growth rates of varying levels. The performance was measured by comparing differences in {$\lambda$} and the generation time calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, age-structured population matrices, and several stage-structured population matrices that were obtained by applying different conversion methods. The results show that the discretization of age introduces only small bias in {$\lambda$} or generation time. Similarly, assuming a fixed age of maturation at the mean age of maturation does not introduce much bias. However, aggregating age-specific survival rates into a stage-specific survival rate and estimating a stage-transition rate can introduce substantial bias depending on the organism's life history type and the true values of {$\lambda$}. In order to aggregate survival rates, the use of the weighted arithmetic mean was the most robust method for estimating {$\lambda$}. Here, the weights are given by survivorship curve after discounting with {$\lambda$}. To estimate a stage-transition rate, matching the proportion of individuals transitioning, with {$\lambda$} used for discounting the rate, was the best approach. However, stage-structured models performed poorly in estimating generation time, regardless of the methods used for constructing the models. Based on the results, we recommend using an age-structured matrix population model or the Euler-Lotka equation for calculating {$\lambda$} and generation time when life table data are available. Then, these age-structured vital rates can be converted into a stage-structured model for further analyses.},

  abstract = {Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.},

  abstract = {Temperature heavily affects the development rate of insects. Until temperatures become too extreme, insects will generally experience greater rates of development at higher temperatures and slower rates of development at lower temperatures. The invasive ambrosia beetle Euwallacea nr. fornicatus Eichhoff, referred to as the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), was tested for development rates at a range of temperatures between 15 and 32 {\textdegree}C. Based on the development rates recorded, it was calculated that the tmin, tmax and topt were 13.34, 33.08 and 27.51 {\textdegree}C, respectively. The number of degree days required for PSHB to complete development from egg to adult was estimated to be approximately 398 degree days. These results can be used to predict the potential distribution of PSHB, as well as where climatic factors may limit their establishment. Furthermore, the development information can be of use when predicting an increase in beetle activity.},

Rates of development changed in a linear fashion over a wide range of temperatures. Estimates of lower development thresholds were obtained for eggs (15.7{$\pm$}0.5{\textdegree}C), larvae (15.8{$\pm$}0.8{\textdegree}C) and pupae (14.3{$\pm$}1.4{\textdegree}C) and the degree days (DD) for development were 70{$\pm$}4.4, 95{$\pm$}8.5 and 72{$\pm$}5.1 DD, respectively. Optimum temperature for development was around 30{\textdegree}C for all stages. Temperature fluctuation in cooler High Country areas (above 1400 m) with a mean temperature around 15{\textdegree}C seems to be critical for the development of the pest, which may be responsible for the near absence of pest in those areas. Temperature fluctuations (18{\textendash}30{\textdegree}C) in the Mid Country region (600{\textendash}1200 m) favor the development of the pest compared to development under constant conditions. The altitudinal distribution of the shot-hole borer across tea growing areas in Sri Lanka is, therefore, mainly governed by temperature.},
