  abstract = {Thermal performance curves (TPCs) depict variation in vital rates in response to temperature and have been an important tool to understand ecological and evolutionary constraints on the thermal sensitivity of ectotherms. TPCs allow for the calculation of indicators of thermal tolerance, such as minimum, optimum, and maximum temperatures that allow for a given metabolic function. However, these indicators are computed using only responses from surviving individuals, which can lead to underestimation of deleterious effects of thermal stress, particularly at high temperatures. Here, we advocate for an integrative framework for assessing thermal sensitivity, which combines both vital rates and survival probabilities, and focuses on the temperature interval that allows for population persistence. Using a collated data set of Lepidopteran development rate and survival measured on the same individuals, we show that development rate is generally limiting at low temperatures, while survival is limiting at high temperatures. We also uncover differences between life stages and across latitudes, with extended survival at lower temperatures in temperate regions. Our combined performance metric demonstrates similar thermal breadth in temperate and tropical individuals, an effect that only emerges from integration of both development and survival trends. We discuss the benefits of using this framework in future predictive and management contexts.},

  abstract = {Symptoms consistent with polyphagous shot hole borer (Euwallacea fornicatus) and Fusarium dieback (Fusarium euwallaceae), recognised as high priority environmental pests for Australia, were observed on a single box elder (Acer negundo) tree in Sydney, New South Wales, in March 2022 during routine forest biosecurity surveillance. Delimiting surveys were undertaken around the Sydney basin, extending radially from the original box elder, resulting in the detection of a further three box elder and one tuckeroo (Cupaniopsis anacardioides) with suspicious symptoms. Samples were taken from the five trees and associated beetles diagnosed using morphological and molecular methods. Associated Fusarium-like fungi were identified according to phylogenetic inference using regions of the internal transcribed spacer, as well as the translation elongation factor 1-{$\alpha$} and RNA polymerase II genes. The tea shot hole borer, Euwallacea perbrevis, was identified along with its known fungal mutualist, Fusarium obliquiseptatum. This pair have been reported in Queensland on avocado (Persea americana) and tuckeroo, and there are unpublished records of E. perbrevis from northern NSW, but this is the first report of both species occurring simultaneously in NSW. The biosecurity response following the initial detection, including the establishment of an Incident Management Team, surveillance, diagnostics, and stakeholder engagement, is discussed. This paper highlights the importance of surveillance for early detection of invasive pests and biosecurity systems and processes for enabling a timely response.},

As part of contingency planning, we examined the cost effectiveness of alternative control strategies that could be used to mitigate urban forest impacts and maintain the benefits of trees to the local communities if eradication was not feasible. At the time this work was undertaken, decision-makers were concerned about the potential need to replace all urban trees susceptible to attack. We considered this strategy alongside less destructive strategies and assessed their cost effectiveness in terms of material and labor costs and the loss of ecosystem services resulting from reduced tree foliage. Using a stochastic simulation model, we found that a strategy that involved pruning necrotic limbs and treating trees biennially with systemic insecticide was almost always more cost effective than removing infested trees and replanting to resistant varieties. We estimated this strategy would cost A\$55-110 million over 50 years, while tree removal would cost \$105-195 million. A third strategy using a mix of chemical suppression and tree removal was also considered in light of new information about the pest's host preferences. With an estimated cost of \$60-110 million, this strategy was only slightly more expensive than using chemical suppression alone and could actually lead to eradication if the host range is as narrow as recent survey data suggests.},

Using geographically and temporally extensive data set of moth trap catches and temperatures across the cotton growing states of India, we predicted the phenology of cotton pink bollworm Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders). Our approach was centered on growing degree days (GDD), a measure of thermal accumulation that provides a mechanistic link between climate change and species' phenology. The phenology change was predicted by calculating absolute error associated with DD and ordinal date, an alternative predictor of phenology, for peak moth abundance. Our results show that GDD outperformed the ordinal dates in predicting peak moth abundance in 6 out of 10 selected locations. Using established thresholds of 13.0/34.0~{$^\circ$}C, mean DD accumulated between the consecutive moth peaks across different years were estimated at 504.05\,{\textpm}\,4.84. Seven generations were determined for pink bollworm in a cropping season, the length of which varied between 35 and 73~days in response to temperature. Pink bollworm population reached its peak during third generation which can be the target for management actions. The study provides essential information for developing pink bollworm management strategies under climate change.},

  abstract = {A matrix population model is a convenient tool for summarizing per capita survival and reproduction rates (collectively vital rates) of a population and can be used for calculating an asymptotic finite population growth rate ({$\lambda$}) and generation time. These two pieces of information can be used for determining the status of a threatened species. The use of stage-structured population models has increased in recent years, and the vital rates in such models are often estimated using a life table analysis. However, potential bias introduced when converting age-structured vital rates estimated from a life table into parameters for a stage-structured population model has not been assessed comprehensively. The objective of this study was to investigate the performance of methods for such conversions using simulated life histories of organisms. The underlying models incorporate various types of life history and true population growth rates of varying levels. The performance was measured by comparing differences in {$\lambda$} and the generation time calculated using the Euler-Lotka equation, age-structured population matrices, and several stage-structured population matrices that were obtained by applying different conversion methods. The results show that the discretization of age introduces only small bias in {$\lambda$} or generation time. Similarly, assuming a fixed age of maturation at the mean age of maturation does not introduce much bias. However, aggregating age-specific survival rates into a stage-specific survival rate and estimating a stage-transition rate can introduce substantial bias depending on the organism's life history type and the true values of {$\lambda$}. In order to aggregate survival rates, the use of the weighted arithmetic mean was the most robust method for estimating {$\lambda$}. Here, the weights are given by survivorship curve after discounting with {$\lambda$}. To estimate a stage-transition rate, matching the proportion of individuals transitioning, with {$\lambda$} used for discounting the rate, was the best approach. However, stage-structured models performed poorly in estimating generation time, regardless of the methods used for constructing the models. Based on the results, we recommend using an age-structured matrix population model or the Euler-Lotka equation for calculating {$\lambda$} and generation time when life table data are available. Then, these age-structured vital rates can be converted into a stage-structured model for further analyses.},

This framework will facilitate communication among research traditions, guide the development of dispersal models for theoretical and applied ecology, and enable common representation across taxonomic groups, encapsulating processes at the source and destination of movement, as well as during the intervening relocation process, while allowing each of these stages in the dispersal process to be addressed separately and in relevant detail. For different research traditions, certain parts of the dispersal process are less studied than others (e.g., seed release processes in plants and termination of dispersal in terrestrial and aquatic animals). The generalized gravity model can serve as a unifying framework for such processes, because it captures the general conceptual and formal components of any dispersal process, no matter what the relevant biological timescale involved. We illustrate the use of the framework with examples of passive (a plant), active (an animal), and vectored (a fungus) dispersal, and point out promising applications, including studies of dispersal mechanisms, total dispersal kernels, and spatial population dynamics.},

This pest--fungus complex has been newly discovered in the commercial deciduous fruit industry (Western Cape, South Africa), where its effect is still unknown. This study explored the impact of PSHB infestation on fruit quality and plant water-use efficiency (WUE) -- as indicated by carbon and nitrogen stable isotope ratios -- of commercially cultivated Packham's Triumph pear trees within the first year of invasion, as well as changes in phenotypic plasticity (trait expression range). The impact of PSHB infestation is currently most evident in fruit quality traits, with a clear distinction between the control and most densely attacked tree categories. Fruit and leaf traits showed high variation and a significant change in phenotypic plasticity. Increased PSHB attack density was associated with smaller, duller-toned, sweeter fruit at the time of harvest and data tended towards reduced plant WUE. Producers can expect significant variation in fruit quality and plant WUE even in hosts without branch dieback, visible plant stress or extensive beetle breeding, especially in orchards where infestations persist beyond the first year. These findings necessitate additional research to describe the long-term impact, examine the threat to other deciduous fruit crops and cultivars and assess the need for adapted management or harvesting methods.},

To assess whether thermal acclimation influences E. fornicatus locomotion performance (i.e., induced plastic responses) that may influence invasion potential, beetles were acclimated to three temperatures (18{$^\circ$}C, 25{$^\circ$}C, and 32{$^\circ$}C), and walking speed was measured across six temperatures (13{$^\circ$}C, 18{$^\circ$}C, 23{$^\circ$}C, 28{$^\circ$}C, 33{$^\circ$}C and 38{$^\circ$}C) per acclimation group to construct thermal performance curves, capturing critical thermal minimum (Tmin), critical thermal maximum (Tmax), thermal breadth (Tbr), optimal performance rate (Umax), across four locomotion traits. We found substantial plasticity of performance curves in E. fornicatus. Generally, cold (18{$^\circ$}C) acclimation increased the thermal range of several locomotor performance traits without affecting performance levels, thereby supporting the colder-is-better hypothesis. To assess the consequences of these plastic responses, using the thermal performance curves established here, movement rates of E. fornicatus in an at-risk orchard area in South Africa were predicted across seasons and considering artificial warm and cold spells. Cold-acclimated beetles exhibited the highest cumulative distance traveled in both summer and winter, while warm-acclimated beetles had the lowest. Therefore, short-term thermal variation significantly influenced E. fornicatus locomotion performance, with cold acclimation notably improving dispersal across a wide range of thermal conditions. These findings highlight the importance of considering recent thermal history when predicting E. fornicatus invasion potential. By integrating these data with microclimatic conditions and functional models, this study offers valuable insights for predicting E. fornicatus spread, informing targeted management strategies, and refining spatially explicit risk assessments to mitigate the impacts of this invasive pest.},

  abstract = {Empirical time series of interacting entities, e.g. species abundances, are highly useful to study ecological mechanisms. Mathematical models are valuable tools to further elucidate those mechanisms and underlying processes. However, obtaining an agreement between model predictions and experimental observations remains a demanding task. As models always abstract from reality one parameter often summarizes several properties. Parameter measurements are performed in additional experiments independent of the ones delivering the time series. Transferring these parameter values to different settings may result in incorrect parametrizations. On top of that, the properties of organisms and thus the respective parameter values may vary considerably. These issues limit the use of a priori model parametrizations. In this study, we present a method suited for a direct estimation of model parameters and their variability from experimental time series data. We combine numerical simulations of a continuous-time dynamical population model with Bayesian inference, using a hierarchical framework that allows for variability of individual parameters. The method is applied to a comprehensive set of time series from a laboratory predator-prey system that features both steady states and cyclic population dynamics. Our model predictions are able to reproduce both steady states and cyclic dynamics of the data. Additionally to the direct estimates of the parameter values, the Bayesian approach also provides their uncertainties. We found that fitting cyclic population dynamics, which contain more information on the process rates than steady states, yields more precise parameter estimates. We detected significant variability among parameters of different time series and identified the variation in the maximum growth rate of the prey as a source for the transition from steady states to cyclic dynamics. By lending more flexibility to the model, our approach facilitates parametrizations and shows more easily which patterns in time series can be explained also by simple models. Applying Bayesian inference and dynamical population models in conjunction may help to quantify the profound variability in organismal properties in nature.},

  abstract = {The management of forest pests relies on an accurate understanding of the species' phenology. Thermal performance curves (TPCs) have traditionally been used to model insect phenology. Many such models have been proposed and fitted to data from both wild and laboratory-reared populations. Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo for estimation, we implement and fit an individual-level, Bayesian hierarchical model of insect development to the observed larval stage durations of a population reared in a laboratory at constant temperatures. This hierarchical model handles interval censoring and temperature transfers between two constant temperatures during rearing. It also incorporates individual variation, quadratic variation in development rates across insects' larval stages, and ``flexibility'' parameters that allow for deviations from a parametric TPC. Using a Bayesian method ensures a proper propagation of parameter uncertainty into predictions and provides insights into the model at hand. The model is applied to a population of eastern spruce budworm (Choristoneura fumiferana) reared at 7 constant temperatures. Resulting posterior distributions can be incorporated into a workflow that provides prediction intervals for the timing of life stages under different temperature regimes. We provide a basic example for the spruce budworm using a year of hourly temperature data from Timmins, Ontario, Canada. Supplementary materials accompanying this paper appear on-line.},

  abstract = {Temperature heavily affects the development rate of insects. Until temperatures become too extreme, insects will generally experience greater rates of development at higher temperatures and slower rates of development at lower temperatures. The invasive ambrosia beetle Euwallacea nr. fornicatus Eichhoff, referred to as the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), was tested for development rates at a range of temperatures between 15 and 32 {$^\circ$}C. Based on the development rates recorded, it was calculated that the tmin, tmax and topt were 13.34, 33.08 and 27.51 {$^\circ$}C, respectively. The number of degree days required for PSHB to complete development from egg to adult was estimated to be approximately 398 degree days. These results can be used to predict the potential distribution of PSHB, as well as where climatic factors may limit their establishment. Furthermore, the development information can be of use when predicting an increase in beetle activity.},

  abstract = {The effect of temperature on the rate of development of Xyleborus fornicatus (Eichh.) was determined by rearing individuals under a range of constant temperatures (15--32{$^\circ$}C). Rates of development changed in a linear fashion over a wide range of temperatures. Estimates of lower development thresholds were obtained for eggs (15.7{\textpm}0.5{$^\circ$}C), larvae (15.8{\textpm}0.8{$^\circ$}C) and pupae (14.3{\textpm}1.4{$^\circ$}C) and the degree days (DD) for development were 70{\textpm}4.4, 95{\textpm}8.5 and 72{\textpm}5.1 DD, respectively. Optimum temperature for development was around 30{$^\circ$}C for all stages. Temperature fluctuation in cooler High Country areas (above 1400 m) with a mean temperature around 15{$^\circ$}C seems to be critical for the development of the pest, which may be responsible for the near absence of pest in those areas. Temperature fluctuations (18--30{$^\circ$}C) in the Mid Country region (600--1200 m) favor the development of the pest compared to development under constant conditions. The altitudinal distribution of the shot-hole borer across tea growing areas in Sri Lanka is, therefore, mainly governed by temperature.},

  abstract = {Xyleborus fornicatus Eichh. (Coleoptera: Scolytidae) is a serious pest of tea, Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze, in Sri Lanka. This insect causes two types of injury. The primary injury is caused during the constructions of galleries in the stems, which results in branch breakages, whereas the secondary injury occurs from wood rot, leading to debilitation of the tea plant. Control has been a difficult task because of its well concealed habit and its wide distribution in the tea growing areas from near sea level up to {$\asymp$} 1,400 m above mean sea level. This review includes a historical perspective of the pest, injury to tea plants, brief description of biology and distribution, factors that influence population numbers, pest management strategies, and the current integrated pest management approach.},
