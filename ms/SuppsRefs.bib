	abstract = {Invasive ambrosia beetles in the Euwallacea nr. fornicatus species complex (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae) threaten avocado production in multiple countries. These pests are currently monitored with lures containing quercivorol; α-copaene was also recently discovered to be an effective attractant. We investigated dispersal behaviour of female E. nr. fornicatus in two Florida avocado groves using mark–release–recapture experiments and laboratory flight mills. Additionally, we estimated the sampling range of quercivorol and α-copaene lures deployed alone and in tandem. The two-component lure recaptured 31.2\% of marked beetles, which was significantly more than quercivorol (11.2\%) or α-copaene (8.8\%) alone. Contour analysis indicated that wind speed and direction can influence the number of females that disperse, as well as the direction and distance of their flight. Two methods were used to estimate sampling range and both of them indicated comparable effective ranges for the three lure treatments, with 80\% of marked beetles being recaptured within 30–35 m of the release point. Average total flight distance in laboratory tests was 81.0 m in 24 h, with a maximum distance recorded at 400 m. The combination of quercivorol and α-copaene lures provides the best detection of pest E. nr. fornicatus in Florida, with a recommended trap spacing of approximately 30 m in surveillance programmes for this pest in avocado groves.},

	abstract = {Abstract 1 Temperature heavily affects the development rate of insects. Until temperatures become too extreme, insects will generally experience greater rates of development at higher temperatures and slower rates of development at lower temperatures. 2 The invasive ambrosia beetle Euwallacea nr. fornicatus Eichhoff, referred to as the polyphagous shot hole borer (PSHB), was tested for development rates at a range of temperatures between 15 and 32 ∘C. 3 Based on the development rates recorded, it was calculated that the tmin, tmax and topt were 13.34, 33.08 and 27.51 ∘C, respectively. 4 The number of degree days required for PSHB to complete development from egg to adult was estimated to be approximately 398 degree days. 5 These results can be used to predict the potential distribution of PSHB, as well as where climatic factors may limit their establishment. Furthermore, the development information can be of use when predicting an increase in beetle activity.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on the rate of development of Xyleborus fornicatus (Eichh.) was determined by rearing individuals under a range of constant temperatures (15 －32oC). Rates of development changed in a linear fashion over a wide range of temperatures. Estimates of lower development thresholds were obtained for eggs (15.7 ± 0.5oC), larvae (15.8 ± 0.8oC) and pupae (14.3 ± 1.4oC) and the degree days (DD) for development were 70±4.4, 95±8.5 and 72±5.1 DD, respectively. Optimum temperature for development was around 30oC for all stages. Temperature fluctuation in cooler High Country areas (above 1400 m) with a mean temperature around 15oC seems to be critical for the development of the pest, which may be responsible for the near absence of pest in those areas. Temperature fluctuations (18－30oC) in the Mid Country region (600－1200 m) favor the development of the pest compared to development under constant conditions. The altitudinal distribution of the shot-hole borer across tea growing areas in Sri Lanka is, therefore, mainly governed by temperature.},
